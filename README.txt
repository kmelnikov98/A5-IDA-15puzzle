To run the program, build on a linux system. Implementation is in C++11, which is specified in the makefile.
This was tested on the CSIL machines.
To run the program, type "make" in the linux terminal. Afterwards, it should produce the executable "Main."
To run the program, simply type "./Main"
This will prop up the IDA solution to a randomly initialized problem, of 50 scrambled moves.
The pattern database is initialized on start-up, in memory.
It should automatically give a solution to the random problem, which can then be followed through.
